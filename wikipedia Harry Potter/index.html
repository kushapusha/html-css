                            Pictures.<sup>[1]</sup></a> It is based on <a href="#">J. K. Rowling's 2000 novel of the same name</a>. The film, which is the fourth instalment 
                            in the <a href="#"><i>Harry Potter</i> film series</a>, was written by <a href="#">Steve Kloves</a> and produced by <a href="#">David Heyman</a>. The story follows <a href="#">Harry's </a>
                            fourth year at <a href="#">Hogwarts</a> as he is chosen by the <a href="#">Goblet of Fire</a> to compete in the Triwizard Tournament.</p>
                        <p>The film is the first of the series to receive a <a href="#">PG-13</a> certificate in the US, and a <a href="#">12A</a> in the UK, and stars <a href="#">Daniel 
                            Radcliffe</a> as Harry Potter alongside <a href="#">Rupert Grint</a> and <a href="#">Emma Watson</a> as Harry's best friends <a href="#">Ron Weasley</a> and <a href="#">Hermione 
                            Granger</a>. It is the <a href="#">sequel</a> to <a href="#"><i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i></a> and is followed by <a href="#"><i>Harry Potter and the Order
                            of the Phoenix.</i></a></p>
                        <p>Filming began in early 2004. The <a href="#">Hogwarts</a> scenes were shot at the
                            <a href="#">Leavesden Film Studios</a>. Five days after its release,
                            the film had grossed over US$102 million at the North American box
                            office, which is the third-highest first-weekend
                            tally for a <i>Harry Potter</i> film behind <a href="#"><i>Harry Potter and the Deathly
                            Hallows – Part 1</i></a> and <a href="#"><i>Part 2</i></a>. <i>Goblet of Fire</i> enjoyed
                            an immensely successful run at the box office, earning $897 million
                                worldwide, which made it the <a href="#">highest-grossing 
                            film of 2005</a> and the <a href="#">eighth-highest-grossing film of all-time</a> at 
                            that time and the sixth-highest-grossing film in 
                            the <i>Harry Potter</i> series.</p>
                        <p>The film was nominated for the <a href="#">Academy Award</a> for <a href="#">Best Art Direction</a>, 
                            and won the <a href="#">BAFTA Award for Best Production Design</a>.
                            <i>Goblet of Fire</i>  was the second film in the series to be released in <a href="#">IMAX</a>. The film is
                            one of the best reviewed instalments
                            within the series, being praised for the higher level of maturity and sophistication of its characters, plotline, tone,
                            screenplay, and the performances of the lead actors.<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup></p>

                        <hr>
                        <p><a href="#">Harry</a> awakens from a nightmare wherein a man named <a href="#">Frank Bryce</a> is killed after overhearing 
                            Lord Voldemort conspiring with <a href="#">Peter Pettigrew</a> and another man. While Harry attends the 
                            <a href="#">Quidditch</a> World Cup match between <a href="#">Ireland</a> and <a href="#">Bulgaria</a> with the <a href="#">Weasleys</a> and <a href="#">Hermione</a>, 
                            <a href="#">Death Eaters</a> terrorise the camp, and the man who appeared in Harry's dream summons the <a href="#">Dark Mark</a>.</p>
                        <p>At <a href="#">Hogwarts</a>, <a href="#">Albus Dumbledore</a> introduces ex-<a href="#">Auror Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody</a> as the new <a href="#">Defence
                            Against the Dark Arts</a> teacher. He also announces that the school will host an event known
                            as the <a href="#">Triwizard Tournament</a>, in which three magical schools compete across three dangerous
                            challenges. The <a href="#">Goblet of Fire</a> selects "champions" to take part in the competition: <a href="#">Cedric
                            Diggory</a> of <a href="#">Hufflepuff</a> representing Hogwarts, <a href="#">Viktor Krum</a> representing the <a href="#">Durmstrang 
                            Institute</a> from Eastern Europe, and <a href="#">Fleur Delacour</a> representing Beauxbatons <a href="#">Academy of Magic</a>
                            from <a href="#">France</a>. The Goblet then unexpectedly selects Harry as a fourth champion. Dumbledore 
                            is unable to pull the underage Harry out of the tournament, as Ministry official <a href="#">Barty Crouch
                            Sr.</a> insists that the champions are bound by a contract after being selected.</p>
                        <p>For the first task, each champion must retrieve a golden egg guarded by the dragon they pick.
                            Harry succeeds in retrieving the egg, which contains information about the second challenge.
                            Shortly after, a formal dance event known as the <a href="#">Yule Ball</a> takes place; Harry and Ron attends
                            <a href="#">Parvati</a> and <a href="#">Padma Patil</a>, Harry's crush <a href="#">Cho Chang</a> attends with Cedric, and Hermione 
                            attends with Viktor, making Ron jealous. The second task involves the champions diving 
                            underwater to rescue their mates. Harry finishes third, but is promoted to second behind 
                            Cedric due to his "moral fibre", after saving Fleur's sister Gabrielle as well as Ron. Afterwards,
                            Harry discovers the corpse of Crouch Sr. in the forest. Later, while waiting for Dumbledore 
                            in his office, Harry discovers a <a href="#">Pensieve</a>, which holds Dumbledore's memories. Harry witnesses
                            a trial in which <a href="#">Igor Karkaroff</a> confesses to the <a href="#">Ministry of Magic</a> names of other Death Eaters
                            after Voldemort's defeat. When he names <a href="#"></a>Severus Snape as one, Dumbledore vouches for Snape's
                            innocence; Snape turned spy against Voldemort before the latter's downfall. After Karkaroff
                            names Barty Crouch Jr., a devastated Crouch Sr. imprisons his son in <a href="#">Azkaban</a>. Exiting the 
                            Pensieve, Harry realizes that Crouch Jr. is the man he saw in his dream.</p>
                        <p>For the final task, the champions must reach the Triwizard Cup, located in a <a href="#">hedge maze</a>. After Fleur
                            and Viktor are incapacitated, Harry and Cedric reach the cup together. The two claim a draw and 
                            together grab the cup, which turns out to be a <a href="#">Portkey</a> and transports them to a graveyard where 
                            Pettigrew and Voldemort are waiting. Pettigrew kills Cedric with the Killing Curse and performs a
                            ritual that rejuvenates Voldemort, who then summons the Death Eaters. Voldemort releases Harry 
                            and challenges him to a duel to prove he is the better wizard. A vulnerable Harry tries the Expelliarmus
                            charm to block Voldemort's attempted <a href="#">Killing Curse</a>. The beams from their wands entwine and Voldemort's
                            wand disgorges the last spells it performed. The spirits of the people he murdered are seen in the
                            graveyard, including Cedric, and <a href="#">Harry's parents</a>. This distracts Voldemort and his Death Eaters,
                            allowing Harry to use the Portkey and escape with Cedric's body.</p>
                        <p>Harry tells Dumbledore that Voldemort returned and killed Cedric. Moody takes Harry back to his office 
                            to interrogate him about Voldemort, inadvertently blowing his cover when he asks Harry about a graveyard,
                            despite Harry not mentioning a graveyard. Moody reveals that he submitted Harry's name to the Goblet
                            of Fire and manipulated Harry throughout the tournament to ensure he would win. Moody attempts to attack
                            Harry, but Dumbledore, Snape, and <a href="#">Minerva McGonagall</a> intervene and subdue him. The teachers force 
                            Moody to drink <a href="#">Veritaserum</a>, and he reveals that the real Moody is imprisoned in a magical trunk as his
                            <a href="#">Polyjuice Potion</a> wears off. He is revealed as Crouch Jr. and returned to Azkaban.</p>
                        <p>Dumbledore reveals to the students that Voldemort killed Cedric, although the Ministry of Magic opposes
                            the revelation. Later, Dumbledore visits Harry in his dormitory, apologizing to him for the dangers he
                            endured. Harry reveals that he saw his parents in the graveyard; Dumbledore names this effect as "<a href="#">Priori
                            Incantatem</a>". Soon after Hogwarts, Durmstrang, and Beauxbatons bid farewell to each other.</p>

                            <p>British film director <a href="#">Mike Newell</a> was chosen to direct the film after <a href="#"><i>Harry Potter and the

                                <i>Potter</i> film.<sup><a href="#">[8]</a></sup> In a statement explaining the transition of directors, series producer
                                <a href="#">David Heyman</a> said:<blockquote>When Alfonso made the decision to focus on completing <i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i>, we were
                                faced with the daunting task of finding a director to handle the complex challenges of <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet 
                                of Fire</i> and to follow in the footsteps of <a href="#">Chris Columbus</a> and Alfonso Cuar?n. Mike's rich and 
                                diverse body of work show him to be the perfect choice. He has worked with children, made us laugh, and had us sitting
                                on the edge of our seats. He is great with actors and imbues all his characters, all his films, with great humanity.
                                I'm thrilled.</blockquote></p>
                            <p><a href="#">Principal photography</a>  for <i>Goblet of Fire</i> began on 4 May 2004,<sup><a href="#">[9]</a></sup> although
                                scenes involving the film's principal actors did not begin filming until 25 June 2004 at England's <a href="#">Leavesden Studios</a>.

                                <p><a href="#">Steve Kloves</a>, the screenwriter for the previous instalments, returned for <i>Goblet of Fire</i>.
                                On adapting the 636-page book into a feature-length film, Kloves commented that "we always thought it would be two movies,
                                but we could never figure out a way to break it in two. So it will be a different experience from the book."<sup><a href="#">[12]</a></sup></p>

We looked into doing a process called 'dry for wet,' where you suspend an actor and blow wind on them to give the illusion that they are underwater, but the hair didn't undulate convincingly.<br>—Heyman, on the underwater scenes<sup><a href="#">[13]</a></sup></aside>
                            <p class="set_design--p">As in the previous instalments, <a href="#">Stuart Craig</a> and <a href="#">Stephenie McMillan</a> provided the 
                                film's set and art designs, respectively. Due to the film's scope, there were many new sets and transformations of 
                                old sets created. McMillan was most excited about redesigning the Great Hall for the scenes involving the Yule Ball.
                                "Originally we thought silver curtains, silver table cloths and an ice dance floor," said McMillan, "but it just went
                                on and on. The drapes man eventually said, 'Why not just stick the fabrics on the wall?'"<sup><a href="#">[14]</a></sup>
                                Each task of the Triwizard Tournament required massive sets. The rock quarry set for the first task, where Harry faces 
                                off with the Hungarian Horntail, was built in two sections at Leavesden Studios. Craig called it "one of the biggest sets
                                we've ever built for any of the films."<sup><a href="#">[13]</a></sup> For the second task, involving the film's underwater
                                scenes, the film crew designed and built a <a href="#">blue screen</a> tank holding "about half a million gallons of water."
                                <sup><a href="#">[15]</a></sup> As for the final task, which took place in the maze, hedge walls ranging from 20 to 40 feet
                                tall were constructed and enhanced with <a href="#">computer-generated imagery</a>.<sup><a href="#">[16]</a></sup></p>

                            <p>Director Mike Newell described the book as "big as a house brick".[22]</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>With the Goblet of Fire novel almost twice the length of Prisoner of Azkaban, the writers and producers reduced certain scenes and concepts to make the transition from page to screen. Director Mike Newell described the problem as one of "compressing a huge book into the compass of a movie".[23] This was achieved by "putting aside" all the components of the novel which did not directly relate to Harry and his journey.[23]</p>
                        <p>Goblet of Fire is the first film adaptation not to begin at Privet Drive; after the opening sequence, Harry awakens at the Burrow on the morning of the Quidditch World Cup.[24]</p>
                        <p>The gameplay at the Quidditch World Cup was removed for timing reasons, leaving an abrupt temporal jump which some reviewers considered awkward or "rushed". In the book, Harry and many of the Weasleys support Ireland, while in the film Harry and Ron support Bulgaria. Nonetheless, both of them admire the Bulgarian seeker Viktor Krum.[25]</p>
                        <p>Other scenes are shortened and amalgamated to include only the most essential plot details: the three Death Eater trials Harry witnesses in the Pensieve are merged into one sequence; the characters of Bill Weasley, Charlie Weasley, Ludo Bagman, Winky, Narcissa Malfoy and Bertha Jorkins are absent, as well as Dobby, who was supposed to help Harry obtain Gillyweed for the second task. Instead, that scene was changed to involve Neville Longbottom. There is no train scene at the end where Rita Skeeter is revealed to be an illegal, unregistered animagus; Harry is never seen either receiving or giving away the 1,000 galleons in prize winnings. All of Sirius Black's lines are condensed into a single fireside conversation. The scene in which Crouch Jr. is taken back to Azkaban is different from the book, in which he was "killed" by a Dementor summoned by Cornelius Fudge. There is also no conversation in which Fudge refuses to believe that Voldemort has returned, so this is explained in the next film.[24]</p>

                        <h3>Wyrd Sisters lawsuit  <small>[ <a href="#">edit</a> ]</small></h3>
                        <p>In the run up to the film, Warner Bros. approached a Canadian folk group called the Wyrd Sisters to obtain permission to use the name THE WEIRD SISTERS for its Harry Potter Band. When a deal could not be made, the Canadian band filed a US$40-million lawsuit against Warner Bros., the North American distributor of the film, as well as the members of the in-movie band (members of the bands Radiohead and Pulp, among others)[33] for the misuse of their group's name. (In a deleted scene, they are simply introduced as "the band that needs no introduction".) The Canadian band also brought an injunction to stop the release of the film in its country as it contained a performance by the identically named fictional rock band. An Ontario judge dismissed this motion, and to avoid further controversy Warner Bros. rendered the band unnamed in the film and many derived products. However, the Winnipeg-based group continued to pursue the lawsuit; lead singer Kim Baryluk stated in her claim that "consumers will assume that the smaller and less famous Canadian band is trying to take advantage of the Harry Potter fame by copying the Harry Potter band's name when in fact the reverse is true."[34] The injunction was dismissed, and the band was ordered to pay costs.[35][36] As of March 2010, the lawsuit has been settled, the details sealed.[37]</p>

                        <h3>Theatrical release  <small>[ <a href="#">edit</a> ]</small></h3>
                        <p>Goblet of Fire was the second film in the series to be given a simultaneous release in conventional theatres and IMAX.[38] Dubbed as Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: The IMAX Experience, the film was digitally remastered for IMAX from its 35mm form to take part in a "commercial growth strategy" set up between IMAX and Warner Bros. Pictures.[39][40]</p>
                        <p>The film was released in most countries within a two-week period starting on 18 November 2005 in the United Kingdom and United States, with a 1 December 2005 release in Australia. In the United States, the film opened in a maximum of 3,858 cinemas that included several IMAX screens.[4]</p>
                        <p>The world premiere of the film took place in London, England on 6 November 2005.[41] One of the features of the premiere was an animatronic, fire-breathing Hungarian Horntail.[42] The 40-foot-long dragon, used during the scene where Hagrid leads Harry into the forest a night before the first task, was designed and built by the film's special effects supervisor John Richardson and creature effects & makeup supervisor Nick Dudman.[13]</p>

                        <p>The film was released on DVD in North America on 7 March 2006. It was available in one- and two-disc editions, as well as part of an 8-disc box set that includes all four films made by that time.[43] The bonus disc features three interactive games, as well as seven behind the scenes featurettes. The film was also released in UMD format for PSP.</p>
                        <p>A VHS release occurred at least in New Zealand and Finland, with the film presented in fullscreen. [44]</p>
                        <p>On its first day of release in North America, over 5 million copies were sold, recording a franchise high for first-day sales. Within its first week it sold over a total of 9 million units of combined sales of both the widescreen and full-screen versions of the DVD.[45]</p>
                        <p>The UK edition was released on DVD on 20 March 2006 and became the fastest selling UK DVD ever, selling six copies per second on its first day of release. According to the Official Charts Company, the DVD sold 1.4 million copies in its first week alone. It is also available in a two-disc edition with special features similar to the North American two-disc edition.[46]</p>
                        <p>Currently, the DVD holds the Guinness World Record for being the fastest selling DVD of all time. The achievement was added to the 2007 book edition of The Guinness World Records, which includes a picture of the award being presented to Dan Radcliffe on set of Order of the Phoenix at Leavesden Film Studios in April 2006.[47]</p>
                        <p>In the United States, the first five Harry Potter films were released on HD DVD and Blu-ray disc on 11 December 2007. The fourth film has since become available in numerous box sets containing the other films released in the series, including the Harry Potter: Complete 8-Film Collection and Harry Potter Wizard's Collection. An Ultimate Edition of Goblet of Fire was released on 19 October 2010, featuring behind-the-scenes footage, trailers, additional scenes, and a feature-length special Creating the World of Harry Potter Part 4: Sound & Music.[48] Despite not being included in the Ultimate Edition, an extended version has been shown during certain television airings with a running time of about 167 minutes.[49]</p>

                        <h3>Box office  <small>[ <a href="#">edit</a> ]</small></h3>
                        <p>After an opening day of $40 million at the North American box office and staying at number 1 for three weeks, The Goblet of Fire made a successful 20-week run in cinemas, closing on 6 April 2006. The film set numerous records, including the highest non-May opening weekend in the US, and earned £14.9m in its opening weekend in the UK, a record which has since been beaten by the 2008 James Bond film Quantum of Solace, which took in £15.4m. The Goblet of Fire drew $102.7 million its opening weekend at the North American box office, setting a new opening high for the franchise and also achieved the highest weekend debut in November, with the latter being surpassed by The Twilight Saga: New Moon in 2009.[50] It sold about as many tickets as Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone did in its opening weekend. The film's franchise record was later overtaken in 2010 by Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1, which opened to $125 million; Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 followed with $169.1 million in its opening weekend. The Goblet of Fire's debut marked the fourth $100 million weekend in history and as of July 2011, it stands as the 17th largest opening weekend ever. In Mainland China, the film generated 93 million yuan.</p>
                        <p>The Goblet of Fire earned almost US$897 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing international and worldwide release of 2005.</p>
                        <p>n IMAX theatres only, the film grossed a total of US$20,033,758 worldwide for a cumulative per screen average of $188,998 thus setting a new record and a new milestone for a digitally remastered 2-D IMAX release.</p>
                        <p>In January 2006, The Goblet of Fire surpassed the box office takings of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) to become the eighth-highest-grossing film worldwide, and the second-highest-grossing film in the Harry Potter series, behind The Philosopher's Stone. As of July 2011, it has been the sixth-highest-grossing Harry Potter film behind The Philosopher's Stone, The Order of the Phoenix and The Half-Blood Prince, The Deathly Hallows – Part 1, and The Deathly Hallows – Part 2.[51]</p>
                        <p>The film ranks third in the North American box office behind Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe for 2005, with US$290 million, although both films rank lower than Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in worldwide terms.[4]</p>

                        <h3>Critical response  <small>[ <a href="#">edit</a> ]</small></h3>
                        <p>On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 249 reviews, with an average rating of 7.47/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "The main characters are maturing, and the filmmakers are likewise improving on their craft; vibrant special effects and assured performances add up to what is the most complex yet of the Harry Potter films."[52] At Metacritic, the film has a score of 81 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[53] On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.[54]</p>
                        <p>The New York Daily News praised the film for both its humour and its dark tone.[55] The young actors were praised for demonstrating a "greater range of subtle emotions",[56] particularly Daniel Radcliffe whom Variety described as delivering a "dimensional and nuanced performance".[57] New cast members were also praised: Brendan Gleeson's portrayal of Mad-Eye Moody was described as "colourful";[57] Miranda Richardson's scenes as Rita Skeeter were described as "wonderful";[55] and Ralph Fiennes's portrayal of Lord Voldemort was described as "sublime villainy".[58]</p>
                        <p>The maturity of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, among others, impressed most critics. While the major characters were portrayed as children in the previous films, "they have subtly transitioned into teenagers (in Goblet of Fire)" according to one USA Today reviewer. Desson Thomson of the Washington Post called the film "Probably the most engaging film of the Potter series thus far".[59] Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal stated "The studio, like plucky Harry, passes with flying colors. The new one, directed by Mike Newell from another astute script by Mr. Kloves, is even richer and fuller, as well as dramatically darker. It's downright scary how good this movie is".[60]</p>
                        <p>Negative criticism included the film's pace which The Arizona Republic described as being "far too episodic",[61] while CNN.com described the film as "clunky and disjointed".[62] Another criticism was that the many supporting characters did not get enough screen time.[57][62] The film was listed at #36 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the 50 Best High School Movies praising Rowling for ingeniously blending "two literary traditions, fantasy and coming-through-school fiction".[63]</p>

                        <p>At the 2006 Kids' Choice Awards, the film won the Blimp Award for Favorite Movie, becoming the only Harry Potter film to do so.[67]</p>
